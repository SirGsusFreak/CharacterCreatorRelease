# CharacterCreatorRelease

This is a fork of cyaggi's fork of TheFlyingMinotaur's original version. All credit to both of them for the bulk of the project, but my personal changes are as follows:

- Added a randomize button for each dropdown.
- Added a button to randomize the entire portrait.
- Changed the dropdowns to include an image along with the filename.

You can get the original version along with TheFlyingMinotaur's seperated sprite resources (for which i'm super thankful!!) at this link of theirs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3ftkk8BdxVbwI-McaIeI2Wm-1heaFlS/view

Just put the jar for my version in the same directory as their resources.
