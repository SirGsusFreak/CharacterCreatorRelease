# CharacterCreatorRelease

The changes to TheFlyingMinotaur's original version are as follows:
- All RGB Sliders were converted into buttons that bring up a ColorChooser window.
  - A "Default" panel containing default skin and hair colors is included
  - Below each button, the light, normal, and dark versions of the chosen color are displayed.
- Dropdown menus were made bigger
- UI rearranged
- An additional slot for accessories (glasses, facial hair, scars, etc) was made.
  - I'm not an artist, so these will have to be added by the user.
- A text file explaining how to add more images and format them was added.
